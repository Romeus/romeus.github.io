      <description>It was a long journey. I heard about Linux Kernel Mentorship Program in the mid of the January, went through the application process and was selected as a mentee. Despite I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a newbie kernel developer, I learnt a lot during my mentorship period. And now, this journey is over and I am graduated.&#xA;I want to thank my wonderful and patient Linux Foundation mentors and experienced kernel developers and maintainers - Shuah Khan, Javier Carrasco Cruz and Julia Lawall from the bottom of my heart for their support, wise and passion.</description>
